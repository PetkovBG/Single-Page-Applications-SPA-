### Login Page

The Login Page has error handling and throws an alert if the username and password do not match as well as if one of the fields is empty.

All fields are required alert message when one of the fields is left empty.

### Register Page
In order to register the user has to put a valid email address, password and to confirm the password.

Again, if any of the fields is left empty then we throw an alert to notify the user.

There is a password validation and if the passwords do not match then we throw an alert.

Upon successfully registering, the user can now log in. The view changes for loggen in user. Logged in users have the option to create an album and we see a Logout button at the upper right corner.

### Create Album
Users can create an album by filling out the necessary fields. Again, there is a validation and all fields must be filled out upon creating the album.

When all fields are filled out and we create the album it appears in the Catalog menu.

We can see the album details by selecting the Details button. Only creators of the album have the option to Edit and Delete it. Example with album creator/owner below.

## Edit Album
Edit Album allows the user to make changes and submit again. The changes reflect immediately.

## Delete Album
When selecting Delete the user has to confirm if he wants to delete the album.
